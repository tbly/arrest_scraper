ArrestScraper
=============

Description goes here
1) using nokogiri, consume the http://www.iowa-city.org/icgov/apps/police/blotter.asp?date=07192011 url (replacing the date value at the end with today's date) and return the most recent incident record containing the name, date, and charges.

Fields names are provided in relation to original screen location in the attached image. 

2) Add the rest of the fields identified in the attached image.

3) The script should be able to take an argument, -n, --number-of-days which then parses the last n days of the posted arrests by cycling through each of the n days by changing the date value in the URL.

In other words, if today is 07192011 and n is set to "3" then you should process the arrests for today and 3 preceding days, which should result in consuming these URLs:

http://www.iowa-city.org/icgov/apps/police/blotter.asp?date=07192011
http://www.iowa-city.org/icgov/apps/police/blotter.asp?date=07182011
http://www.iowa-city.org/icgov/apps/police/blotter.asp?date=07172011
http://www.iowa-city.org/icgov/apps/police/blotter.asp?date=07162011

4) For each day, the script should create a single ArrestDay object that contains an array of Arrest objects.
